Tenzies Game

HI :)

This is a React-based game application called Tenzies, created by Gombos Ovidiu. 
Tenzies is a dice game where the player must roll a set of dice until they all show the same value.

This application is built from scratch with the help of a tutorial, but 
it includes some extra features such as a roll counter and record, 
a timer, and real dice faces, which are not included in the tutorial.

The game is simple to play and is intended for all ages. 
The goal of the game is to get all the dice to show the same value. 
Players can select and deselect dice to roll them again. 
The game is won when all the dice show the same value.
